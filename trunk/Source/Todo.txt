	- Modify Start method of the Application class as follow: [Done]
		+ Accept multiple parameters as a params array [Done]
		+ Mechanism for Application capability to subcribe on parameters [Need more investigation]
	- Refactor Application inheritance tree. [Done]
		+ Create something like ApplicationFeature which would be aggregated in to Application. [Capability]
		+ Make Application class sealed. No longer dynamical load needed, only create Application object <?> [OK, sealed]
		+ Application features should be defined in <application_config> [<capability>]
		+ Every feature has it own Init function with parameter, from config.xml also [Need more investigation]
		
28-10-2008: (duongna)
	- Refactor code generation in DTOMakerClassGenerator [Done]
	- Benchmark JIT and Reflection approach again [Done, JIT is 2 times faster than Reflection and 2 times slower than ADO in the simplest case]

29-10-2008: (duongna)
	- Refactor ColumnAttribute. It's in a very naive form now. [Done]
	- Null management in DTOBase [Done, great serialization implementation]
	- Extend TableMapper.GetObject to:
		+ Check null in DTO, need to modify DTOMaker also [Done]
		+ GenericDTO with full serialization [Done]
		+ PONO, Null case also [Done]
		+ Consider between Nullable and boxed type in PONO, including serializable check [Done, It's DTO generator's job. Framework support both]
	- Expression language with unit test on GetObjects: DTO, GenericDTO, PONO [Done]
31-10-2008: (duongna)
	- Option to disable Schema support in GenericDTO. [pending]
	  (GenericDTO need schema in case of serialization, otherwise every column value will become string after being serialized)
	- Implement Join on TableMapper. Idea: new TableMapper<A>().Join(new TableMapper<B>, expJoinCondition, JoinType.Inner).GetObjects() [Pending]
01-11-2008: (duongna)
	- Simple DTOGenerator, (DTO generator should be written in FR50)[70% done, main function, Save configuration is pending]
	- New Graphic Test Runner
	- Overload for GetObjects - now is Select [Done]
	- Support Select * for GenericDTO [Done]
	- Rename CRUD method on TableMapper - Persistence layer. (Get, Add, Save, Delete should be reserved for OR layer) [Done]
	- Random class suffix for generated DTO Maker. [Done, use the same namespace with DTO, like the proxy's solution]
	  (When we have 2 classes AutoDTO in 2 different namespace, DTOMakerClassGenerator will cause duplicate error)
	- Option to allow schema translation or not - (datasource level or global level?)
	  (converion when there is type mismatch between DataReader's schema and DTO's schema
	   this situation may happen when change to another DB provider, rather than the DB provider which generated the DTO)
		+ check this option when generated DTOMaker to have optimized code
		+ check this option on ReflectionDTOMaker
	- Todo file in other format (excel? google issues tracker?)
	- Loadtest support. Should use [LoadTest] to mark the method to be metered [Done]
	- parameter to disable table_prefix on MappedTable. Example: when using INFORMATION_SCHEMA [Done]
04-11-2008: (duongna)
	- Support to map table from a query (and a stored procedure also). Base on this, Join can be implemented. Should have a property in MappedTable attribute
	- Refactor XmlBinder, ConfigurationIOManager. Complete Marshal and Save [Done]
	- Highlight code in generator (low priority, consider, using HTML Viewer and parse code by flow) [Done]
06-11-2008: (duongna)
	- XMLSubSequence does not support primitive type. Currently, only support XmlClass. [pending]
18-11-2008: (duongna)
	- Working directory for testsuites
	- JIT have problem with dynamically loaded assembly, ex: FrameworkTest. Investigate and fix.
	- TableMapper support Gurucore style database convention only. Need a bridge solution for legacy DBs.
	- Use List<> instead of array for internal methods' parameters [Considering]
	- DTOMaker can fill existing DTO [Done]
22-11-2008: (duongna)
	- Update DTO from TableMapper always cause update every column. Should apply column versioning:
		+ with object derived from DTOBase , add a version map like nullmap
		+ with PONO object, proxy the PONO object to manage property's version
		+ Consider to merge DTOBase and PONO, using proxy for both version and nullmap.
	- Proxy framework 
		+ support both programatic and declarative ways. Currently it support only declarative way.
		+ support property also
08-12-2008: (duongna)
	- Proxy framework
		+ support custom template
	- DTO
		+ Generate column state property instead of using Dictionary
