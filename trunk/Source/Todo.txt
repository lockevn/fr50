	- Modify Start method of the Application class as follow: [Done]
		+ Accept multiple parameters as a params array [Done]
		+ Mechanism for Application capability to subcribe on parameters [Need more investigation]
	- Refactor Application inheritance tree. [Done]
		+ Create something like ApplicationFeature which would be aggregated in to Application. [Capability]
		+ Make Application class sealed. No longer dynamical load needed, only create Application object <?> [OK, sealed]
		+ Application features should be defined in <application_config> [<capability>]
		+ Every feature has it own Init function with parameter, from config.xml also [Need more investigation]

	- Refactor code generation in DTOMakerClassGenerator [Done]
	- Benchmark JIT and Reflection approach again [Done, JIT is 2 times faster than Reflection and 2 times slower than ADO in the simplest case]

29-10-2008: (duongna)
	- Refactor ColumnAttribute. It's in a very naive form now. [Done]
	- Null management in DTOBase [Done, great serialization implementation]
	- Extend TableMapper.GetObject to:
		+ Check null in DTO, need to modify DTOMaker also [Done]
		+ GenericDTO with full serialization [Done]
		+ PONO, Null case also [Done]
		+ Consider between Nullable and boxed type in PONO, including serializable check [Done, It's DTO generator's job. Framework support both]
	- Expression language with unit test on GetObjects: DTO, GenericDTO, PONO [Done]
31-10-2008: (duongna)
	- Option to disable Schema support in GenericDTO. [pending]
	  (GenericDTO need schema in case of serialization, otherwise every column value will become string after being serialized)
	- Implement Join on TableMapper. Idea: new TableMapper<A>().Join(new TableMapper<B>, expJoinCondition, JoinType.Inner).GetObjects() [Pending]
01-11-2008: (duongna)
	- Simple DTOGenerator, (DTO generator should be written in FR50)
	- New Graphic Test Runner
	- Overload for GetObjects - now is Select [Done]
	- Support Select * for GenericDTO [Done]
	- Rename CRUD method on TableMapper - Persistence layer. (Get, Add, Save, Delete should be reserved for OR layer) [Done]
	- Random class suffix for generated DTO Maker. [Done, use the same namespace with DTO, like the proxy's solution]
	  (When we have 2 classes AutoDTO in 2 different namespace, DTOMakerClassGenerator will cause duplicate error)
	- Option to allow schema translation or not - (datasource level or global level?)
	  (converion when there is type mismatch between DataReader's schema and DTO's schema
	   this situation may happen when change to another DB provider, rather than the DB provider which generated the DTO)
		+ check this option when generated DTOMaker to have optimized code
		+ check this option on ReflectionDTOMaker
	- Todo file in other format (excel? google issues tracker?)
	- Loadtest support. Should use [LoadTest] to mark the method to be meter [Done]
	- parameter to disable table_prefix on MappedTable. Example: when using INFORMATION_SCHEMA [Done]
